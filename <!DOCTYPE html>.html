    <h2>1. Website Purpose</h2>

        The main purpose of the UWEC CSSA website is to serve as an information and
        communication platform for Chinese students and international students at
        the University of Wisconsin–Eau Claire. The website is designed to introduce
        the organization, promote events, and provide helpful resources for new and
        current students.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Target Users</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Current Chinese students at UWEC</li>

        <li>Non-Chinese students interested in CSSA events</li>
        <li>University staff and other student organizations</li>
    </ul>

        The About Us page explains the mission and goals of CSSA. This page builds
        credibility and helps users understand the purpose of the organization and
        its role on campus.
    </p>

    <h3>Events Page</h3>

        The Events page lists upcoming and past activities organized by CSSA.
        This feature encourages student participation and keeps members informed
        about social and cultural events.

        The New Students Guide provides practical information for incoming students,
        such as campus life tips and local resources. This feature adds real value
        and supports students during their transition to UWEC.
    </p>

    <h3>Our Team Page</h3>
    <p>
        The Our Team page introduces the CSSA executive board members. By showing
        names and roles, the website appears more organized and trustworthy.

    <h2>4. How the Design Meets Expectations</h2>
    <p>
        The website design meets the expectations by focusing on clear structure,
        simple navigation, and user-friendly content. Each page has a specific
        purpose, and the overall layout ensures that users can easily find the
        information they need.
    </p>

    <p>
        The design also reflects agreement among group members on the main features
        of the website, such as event promotion and student support. This HTML page
        demonstrates my understanding of the website goals and the agreed-upon
        features discussed within the group.
